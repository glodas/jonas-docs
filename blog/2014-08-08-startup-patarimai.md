Kelios mintys, kurias užsirašiau iš susitikimo su investuotoju Hong Konge:

- Better be lucky than good.
- Make friends, and remember them
- There are more people to help you, than don’t help
- There are more stupid answers than questions
- Show instead of words
- Persuade others that idea is good, not just because you think it’s good
- Quit full time job, before asking investment from specific investors
- Have co-partner
- Have co-work space open 24/7, AC - on.
- Seed money -> free money: yours, friends’, etc.
- Accelerator - environment (dropbox, amazon services provided etc)
- There are lots of investors - Angel Investors, unds, etc. If one said no, other can say yes.
